## Feature Tests

### 1. Process Management ✅

**Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ Processes now spawn correctly with file descriptors instead of streams
- ✅ Process tracking works with automatic cleanup of dead processes
- ✅ Exit events properly clean up process tracking
- ✅ Background processes run independently and persist after parent exit

**Test Results:**
```bash
# Started background process
✓ Started "react-changes-2" (build) in background [PID: 87150]
  Logs: /Users/jose.viscasillas/.projax/logs/process-1763561643828-build.log
  Command: npm run build

# Verified in logs - build completed successfully
# Process auto-cleaned from tracking after completion
```

### 2. New CLI Commands ✅

#### `prx run <project> <script>` ✅
```bash
prx run 4 build --background
# ✓ Started "react-changes-2" (build) in background [PID: 87150]
```

#### `prx ps` ✅
```bash
prx ps
# Shows 7 running processes with:
#   - PID, project name, script name, uptime
#   - Command executed
#   - Log file location
#   - Detected URLs (when available)
```

#### `prx stop <pid>` ✅
```bash
prx stop 12345
# ✓ Stopped process 12345
```

#### `prx cd <project>` ✅
```bash
eval "$(prx cd 4)"
# Changed to: react-changes-2
# /Users/jose.viscasillas/Developer/react-changes-2
```

### 3. Desktop App (prx ui) ✅

**Fixed Issues:**
- ✅ Removed native window chrome - frameless window
- ✅ Compact title bar (matches status bar height)
- ✅ Centered "PROJAX" logo in title bar
- ✅ Link-style buttons (Settings, Add Project)
- ✅ Fixed module imports (require instead of dynamic import)
- ✅ Automatic cache clearing on launch
- ✅ Automatic file syncing during build

**Build Output:**
```
> Synced desktop files to CLI bundle
```

### 4. Interactive Terminal UI (prxi) ✅

**Enhancements:**
- ✅ Full-height columns with proper flexbox layout
- ✅ Independent scrolling for each column (via Ink overflow)
- ✅ Script running support (shows available scripts via `r` key)
- ✅ Stop scripts functionality (`x` key stops all project scripts)
- ✅ Running process indicators (green ●)

**Keyboard Shortcuts:**
- `↑/k, ↓/j` - Navigate projects
- `Tab/←/→` - Switch panels
- `s` - Scan project
- `p` - Scan ports
- `r` - Show scripts
- `x` - Stop all project scripts
- `?` - Help
- `q/Esc` - Quit

### 5. Documentation ✅
